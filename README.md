# Focus Landing Page

This is a standalone web page, allowing users to input their name and a task they are currently focusing on. The background and greeting will change based on the time of day. Users have the option to fomat the clock with two buttons at the bottom corners of the web page.

This project originated from "Traversy Media" on Youtube.
